# Project's title: Rick and Morty character searcher

## Description

Welcome to the Rick and Morty's favourite place, in which you, as well as they, can review all the information needed to follow the serie. You can if a character is dead, alive, from which planet does it come from, etc.

## Technologies

This web page was made using HTML5, SaSS, React, JS, localStorage, API requests, propTypes, React Router DOM and the React Starter Kit, who uses NodeJS, Gulp and JSON.

Please, take into account that all HTML, SaSS and React file are divided in components. Both SaSS and React files are named the same so it is easy to maintain and more ordered. All of them have descriptive names according to the place of the page they are developing or working on.

## Table of contents and How to Use the Project

At the beginning of the page, just after the logo, you can find the filter, in which, guided by the placeholder, you can insert your request. The matches of your request will be displayed just after the filter. Filters work word by word as they are searching for every change.

If you find your character, you can click on the card (each place you want, as it is all a link) and it will reconducted you to the character details, in which you will found more information about it.

Both the links are shareable, so don't hesitate to send you finding with your friends!

And as the localStorage is active, you will never lose the data you have searched for.
